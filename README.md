Some random notes, cheatsheets and sample exploits I'm writing while learning binary exploitation from sources like:
- live overflow
- the shellcodes handbook
- exploit-education's protostar and fusion challenges
- gynvael coldwind
- corelan
- fuzzysecurity

Solutions for protostar stack challenges (bof, shellcode, ret2libc, ROP) : [medium post link goes here, WIP]  
Solutions for protostar format string challenges (memory leaks and corruption): [medium post link goes here, WIP]
